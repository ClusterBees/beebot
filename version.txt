Last Updated: July 17, 2025

🐝 Welcome to BeeBot v0.1.5!
This version rolls out shiny new slash commands and embedded messaging to make BeeBot easier to use, more beautiful, and more reliable across your hives.

🌻 What’s New in v0.1.5:

✅ New /announce slash command
• Sends announcements as rich Discord embeds

• Includes robust error handling and feedback

💬 Auto-reply upgraded to slash command /autoreply
• Toggle AI replies per-channel
• View current status any time
• Auto-enabled in threads by default (OFF elsewhere unless set)

🔧 Improved fallback logic
• Falls back to #announcements if no channel is configured
• Fetches channels directly from the API to avoid cache misses
