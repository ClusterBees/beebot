Version 2.0.1.d  
🔄 Switched from MySQL to Redis for faster, more scalable settings storage
⚙️ Overhauled settings system — BeeBot now saves per-guild configuration using Redis keys
💬 Improved auto-reply logic to support Redis-based channel toggles
📁 Fully removed reliance on JSON or SQL-based storage systems

🐝 What’s New:

⚡ Redis Integration: All guild settings (auto-reply, announcement channels, version channels) are now stored in Redis for speed and scalability.

🚀 No more JSON or MySQL — BeeBot is now lighter and more cloud-ready.

🧠 Auto-reply rewrite: Uses Redis to track which channels have BeeBot auto-replies enabled or disabled.

🔧 Simplified the bot’s environment — easier to deploy with .env Redis settings.

🌟 All previous features remain untouched — just a leaner, buzzier BeeBot behind the scenes!
🔐 Reminder: if you're self-hosting, make sure your Redis server has persistence enabled.
