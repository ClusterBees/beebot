─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Emotion Map Upgrade  
  ▸ Added nuanced vocabulary to recognize complex emotions such as shame, rejection, overstimulation, grief, and fatigue.  
  ▸ Updated `EMOTION_MAP` includes: sad, happy, angry, anxious, ashamed, rejected, tired, and neutral.

• Tone-Based Ritual System  
  ▸ Introduced `choose_response_style()` to map emotion categories to six tones: gentle, soothing, validating, supportive, cheerful, and neutral.  
  ▸ Created `TONE_RITUALS` message bundles for each tone category to infuse empathy, comfort, and warmth into responses.

• AI Prompt Enrichment  
  ▸ Refactored `ai_response()` to incorporate detected emotion, ritual messaging, and context-aware history blending.  
  ▸ Persona switching dynamically responds to serious mode, thread status, and emotional tone.  
  ▸ Emotional context now influences OpenAI prompts for more personalized replies.

• Companion Responsiveness Enhancement  
  ▸ BeeBot now shifts its voice gently for vulnerable users and brightly for celebratory ones—responding as a nurturing, emotionally attuned companion.
