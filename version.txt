🐝 BeeBot Update: v0.1.7 is Live!
Version: 0.1.7 (Fresh Hive Build)
Date: July 17, 2025

BeeBot just got a little smarter in the hive. This update improves how BeeBot handles conversations in dynamic threads — especially inside forums.

🔧 What’s New in v0.1.7
💬 Auto-Reply Now Works in Threads by Default
• BeeBot will respond to all messages in threads, even if /autoreply hasn’t been explicitly enabled
• Works for forum post threads, standard threads, and temporary discussion channels
• Prevents confusion when users start new threads expecting BeeBot to reply

🤖 More Conversational Behavior
• BeeBot now responds to all non-command messages in autoreply-enabled channels, not just questions
• Makes BeeBot feel more responsive and natural in chat

🧠 Reminder:
You can still toggle auto-reply with:

bash
Copy
Edit
/autoreply on
/autoreply off
✨ Status:
This version smooths out BeeBot’s presence in forums and sets the stage for smarter context-aware replies in future releases. Stay tuned — and keep buzzing! 🐝💛
